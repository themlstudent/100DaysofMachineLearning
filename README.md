### Basic of Python


Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."[30] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5. and later are supported.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.

# Day 2

### Working on List ,Loops and Data Stucture.

#### About List

A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

Lists are great to use when you want to work with many related values. They enable you to keep data together that belongs together, condense your code, and perform the same methods and operations on multiple values at once.

When thinking about Python lists and other data structures that are types of collections, it is useful to consider all the different collections you have on your computer: your assortment of files, your song playlists, your browser bookmarks, your emails, the collection of videos you can access on a streaming service, and more.

#### About Loops
In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement −

#### 3.Decision Making 

Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute 
if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

Example: If Else statement

# Day 3

### Working on Function ,Object Oriented Programming ,Exception Handling.

#### About Function 

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
Python provides built-in functions like print(), etc. but we can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.

#### About Object Oriented Programming 

Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.
Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.
Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task.
The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.

#### About Exception Handling

Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.

### Working Started with Pandas Library.

![](/images/pn.png)

Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.

In 2008, developer Wes McKinney started developing pandas when in need of high performance, flexible tool for analysis of data.

Prior to Pandas, Python was majorly used for data munging and preparation. It had very little contribution towards data analysis. Pandas solved this problem. Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data — load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze.

Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.

# Day 6 
### Working With Data Analysis:
![](/images/da3.png)

Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.

Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.

### Working on Plotting Tools :

Data visualization gives many insights that data alone cannot. Python has some of the most interactive data visualisation tools. The most basic plot types are shared between multiple libraries, but others are only available in certain libraries. 

Data journalist and information designer, David McCandless, talking about the significance of data visualization in his TED talk had said, “By visualizing information, we turn it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes, a sort of information map. And when you’re lost in information, an information map is kind of useful.” Here are the top 5 visualisation libraries of Python.

### Top Python Libraries for Data Visualization

1. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is the most popular data visualization library of Python and is a 2D plotting library. It is the most widely-used library for plotting in the Python community and is more than a decade old. It comes with an interactive environment across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers and four graphical user interface toolkits. It is a very versatile visualization library. With this library, with just a few lines of code, one can generate plots, bar charts, histograms, power spectra, stemplots, scatterplots, error charts, pie charts and many other types. The pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface, particularly when combined with IPython. Matplotlib predates HTML5’s support for rich web applications, focusing instead on static images for publication along with interactive figures using desktop-GUI toolkits like Qt and GTK.

2. Plotly

Plotly is a web-based toolkit to form data visualisations. Plotly can also be accessed from a Python Notebook and has a great API. With unique functionalities such as contour plots, dendrograms, and 3D charts, it has visualizations like scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, multiple axes, subplots and many others. It contains a great API including one for Python. It also has contour plots, something which is not very common in other libraries.

3. Seaborn

The Python data visualization library of Seaborn is a library based on Matplotlib. It provides a much more terse API for creating KDE-based visualizations. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is tightly integrated with PyData stack, including support for numpy and pandas data structures. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on data frames and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.

4. ggplot

Ggplot is a Python implementation of the Grammar of Graphics of R programming language. It is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on the Grammar of Graphics and is tightly integrated with Pandas. Once it is told how to map the variables to aesthetics and what primitives to use, it takes care of all the details. Ggplot’s method is not designed for creating highly customised graphics.

5. Altair

The Python library of Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library and has a simple API, is friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar. A declarative library needs one to only mention the links between the data columns to the encoding channels and the rest plotting is handled automatically. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code. The source of Altair is available on GitHub. It is easy to design effective and beautiful visualizations with a minimal amount of code using Altair.

Today I learned about Machine Learning that what is Machine Learning ,why we use machine Learning,where we use machine learning and how we are using machine learning nowdays.
 
### About Machine Learning :



Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

# Day 11 
 
 I learned about types of Machine Learning that is :
 
 ![](/images/sl1.png)
 
## Supervised Learning
  
   Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output parameters. 
   In this type of  learning both training and validation datasets are labelled as shown in the figures below.
  

### Types Of Supervised Learning 

  ![](/images/sl3.png) 

 ### Classification 
 
 Classification is used to predict a discrete label. The outputs fall under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many situations have only two possible outcomes. This is called binary classification (True/False, 0 or 1, Hotdog / not Hotdog).


### For example:
<ul>
 <li>Predict whether an email is spam or not</li>
 <li>Predict whether it will rain or not</li>
 <li>Predict whether a user is a power user or a casual user</li>
 </ul>
 
Multi-label classification is when there are multiple possible outcomes. It is useful for customer segmentation, image categorization, and sentiment analysis for understanding text. To perform these classifications, we use models like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVMs.

### Regression 

Regression is used to predict outputs that are continuous. The outputs are quantities that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels.


### For example:
<ul>
 <li>Predict the height of a potted plant from the amount of rainfall</li>
 <li>Predict salary based on someone’s age and availability of high-speed internet</li>
 <li>Predict a car’s MPG (miles per gallon) based on size and model year</li>
 </ul>
 
 ## Unsupervised Learning 
 
 
 
 Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs.[1] It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques.
 
 ## Reinforcement learning
 
 Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
 
 # Day 12 - 18
 
 
 ### I stared Learning about Regression.
 
![](/images/rr.png)

### What is Regression Analysis?

Regression Analysis is a Form of Predictive Modeling  Technique which investigates the relationship between
a dependent (Target) and independent variable(Predictor).This Technique is used for forceasting, Time Series modelling and finding the Casual Effect Relationship between variables. For Examples ,relationship between rash driving  and number of road accidents by driver is best studied through regression.

Regression analysis is a Important Tool for modelling and analyzing data. Here we  fit a curve / line to the data points ,in such a manner that the differences between the distances of data points from the curve or line is minimized.

### Benefits of using regression Analysis:

  1. It indicates the siginificant relationship between dependent variable and  independent variable.
  
  2. It indicates the strength of impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.
  
Regression analysis also allows us to compare  the effects of variables measured on different scales,such as the effect 
of price changes and the number of promotional Activities.Thes benfits help market reserchers/data analysis / data scientist to eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to be used for bulding predictive models.

# Day 19 - 23

I stareted Learning About Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning:

The metrics that you choose to evaluate your machine learning algorithms are very important.

Choice of metrics influences how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared. They influence how you weight the importance of different characteristics in the results and your ultimate choice of which algorithm to choose.

## Classification Related Metrics

### Warming up: Types of Predictive models:

When we talk about predictive models, we are talking either about a regression model (continuous output) or a classification model (nominal or binary output). The evaluation metrics used in each of these models are different.

In classification problems, we use two types of algorithms (dependent on the kind of output it creates):

#### Class output: 

Algorithms like SVM and KNN create a class output. For instance, in a binary classification problem, the outputs will be either 0 or 1. However, today we have algorithms which can convert these class outputs to probability. But these algorithms are not well accepted by the statistics community.

#### Probability output: 

Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost etc. give probability outputs. Converting probability outputs to class output is just a matter of creating a threshold probability.

In regression problems, we do not have such inconsistencies in output. The output is always continuous in nature and requires no further treatment.

### 1. Confusion Matrix :

A confusion matrix is an N X N matrix, where N is the number of classes being predicted. For the problem in hand, we have N=2, and hence we get a 2 X 2 matrix. Here are a few definitions, you need to remember for a confusion matrix :

Accuracy : the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct.
Positive Predictive Value or Precision : the proportion of positive cases that were correctly identified.
Negative Predictive Value : the proportion of negative cases that were correctly identified.
Sensitivity or Recall : the proportion of actual positive cases which are correctly identified.
Specificity : the proportion of actual negative cases which are correctly identified.

![](/images/cm.png)

![](/images/cm2.png)

The accuracy for the problem in hand comes out to be 88%.  As you can see from the above two tables, the Positive predictive Value is high, but negative predictive value is quite low. Same holds for Sensitivity and Specificity. This is primarily driven by the threshold value we have chosen. If we decrease our threshold value, the two pairs of starkly different numbers will come closer.

In general we are concerned with one of the above defined metric. For instance, in a pharmaceutical company, they will be more concerned with minimal wrong positive diagnosis. Hence, they will be more concerned about high Specificity. On the other hand an attrition model will be more concerned with Sensitivity. Confusion matrix are generally used only with class output models.
